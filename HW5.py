#2. Create a list that contains 3 integers
numList = [1, 4, 9]

#3. Create an if statement that prints out whichever of the three numbers is the highest
if numList[0] > numList[1] and numList[0] > numList[2]:
    print("A is the biggest number.")
elif numList[1] > numList[0] and numList[1] > numList[2]:
    print("B is the biggest number.")
elif numList[2] > numList[0] and numList[2] > numList[1]:
    print("C is the biggest number.")
else:
    print("They are all equal.")
