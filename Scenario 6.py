#After an extended leave, the team lead for the RPG developer is back, and he wants to continue the project.
#He wants to prototype the character creation model but first needs something that rolls stats for the characters.
#He wants you to make a function that rolls 4 six-sided dice (d6), sorts them from highest to lowest, and then adds the
#highest 3 together. He then wants you to add that result to a list outside the function. He wants you to run that function
#5 more times (six times total) and print all six stats.

def diceRoll():
    stat1 = [random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6)]
    print(stat1)
    stat1.sort(reverse=True)

    sum = (stat1[0] + stat1[1] + stat1[2])
    statList.append(sum)


statList = []

def rollStat():
    for i in range(5):
        diceRoll()
        print(statList)

rollStat()

#Once that is done, to ensure that the average of the statblock is fair (somewhere roughly between 12-13), he wants you
#to plug it into a calculator (Scenario 7) and print the average.
